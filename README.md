# SpotifyActivity
React Native App to view Spotify friend activity on mobile.

## Description
The Spotify desktop client gives users the ability to view their friend's activity. Users can see which songs and playlists their friend's have recently listened to. 
Unfortunately, this feature is not available on Spotify's mobile app on Android and iOS. This data is also not available on Spotify's API and it doesn't look like they 
plan to change this anytime soon. 

## Why?
Since I want to be able to stalk my friends, I created this app to allow users to create spotify web requests through their phones. With a couple extra steps, 
you can get access to friend activity data.
